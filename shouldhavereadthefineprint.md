I just feel sad, and I don’t really know how to start saying what I want to say.

I feel like there are a thousand things I’d like to say, but I know there’s a thousand more ways you’d shoot me down. 


Instead, I’m just going to accept that this will probably be a rambling mess, and I feel like I’m caught between lines that I can’t see.
I figured that if I asked you to call, the words would come to me when I heard your voice … but here I am.


I know you tried to treat things as logically as you could when we talked. 
I know that you kept trying to think of doing only what’s best for you, and I know that you could hear the faint whispers of all the suggestions from all the things other people had said to you. 
I guess they just never felt like your words, though. More like things you’d rehearsed.
I’m not writing this to change your mind though, this is just my way of processing things.

I said I’d respect your choices, even if they hurt.


You said I made a choice back in February, and that you came second.

I know you will probably never look at the situation I do, but I genuinely thought that sometimes if you loved someone you had to walk away.

I feel like Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting, when he makes the mistake of leaving the girl. I’m there, in the audience, screaming at my life on the screen, telling myself not to make the mistake.

But as always, here I am.. A day late, and a dollar short.


You were my medication, but I feel like I’ve gone too long without taking you.

If you were to ask a younger version of me where I thought I’d be after 30, I don’t think this would even factor into it. Adulting is hard. So much harder than Hollywood and books ever made it seem.

It’s hard enough to keep friends, let alone to keep hold of those you love.

I know I dragged you down this year, kicking and screaming. Against your will.
And I know that no amount of apologies will ever really make up for what you went through as a result of that.
I don’t blame you for holding onto that. I know I would have probably done the same in your situation.


That doesn’t change that in my own selfish way, I feel like we aren’t done.
It feels like someone’s come along and taken away the pieces of paper we could have carried on writing our story on.
That isn’t me saying I expect us to fall into the past, into old comforts, and old habits. Old cycles.


The reason I was so weirdly happy last Monday when we finally talked after all this time was because it felt like a missing piece of a jigsaw had just slotted back into my life. Stupidly enough, a piece I hadn’t realised how much I had missed.

Maybe it’s been the time we’ve known each other. The passage of years, and the closeness, have made it feel like you’re as much a piece of how I imagine my days as the air I breathe. And like the air, I feel like I’ve been holding my breath without realising it for the past 6 months.
I can feel the way our personalities spark around each other. I’m not even saying that romantically - just the enchanted push and pull that feels as natural as the tide when I talk to you.

I don’t really think you realise quite how much knowing you has changed me. I’ll always argue until my dying day that it’s been for the better.
I feel like I am the person that I am these days largely because of you.
The way I process things. The way I try to structure things. The way I think of aesthetics, or cute things. It’s like there’s a mini Mon sitting on my shoulder softly speaking her opinion into my ear.

It won’t make any difference to me whether or not I hide the objects in my life that are from you, or remind me of you - that’s just not how my mind works. Maybe I just prefer to hold onto the past. Or maybe I just like to dwell on things too much. 
But even if I put everything away in storage, or hid it in the attic .. I’d still end up thinking of you constantly.

I felt like I was myself around you in such a comfortable way. 
That your joking insults just don’t really feel like insults when they leave your mouth because I find myself smiling and grinning like an idiot at the creativity of your comments. Your dry humour is like cocaine to me, and I’m a relapsing addict.

I’ve even been watching this Youtube series called Financial Audit by Caleb Hammer just because of offhand comments you made about the way I’m handling my money.
Like I said, you’re a better influence on me than you realise.


I know it’s my own failures that hold me back. I know that some things I pick up quickly … and others, painfully slow. I’m coming to accept that. I’m not there yet, but hopefully one day I will be.
I died a little inside when you pointed out that the second person I let down was Zoe. That one hit hard. I feel like I’ve been brought low and humbled by the mess I’ve made of this year, for myself, and for everyone around me.

Maybe you were right all along when you said I needed glasses. I guess you were just wrong about the reasons why. It’s not that I still think you’re gorgeous - you just are. It’s my perspective that I needed better lenses for.
I know I deserve the place I’m at right now, but that doesn’t mean i’ll ever really be okay with where I am. At least I can spend this time working on myself.


You know, that bike that I thought was probably a scam turned out to be real. It arrived this afternoon.
At least I can’t make a bike hate me, or disappoint it.



I wish I could say that I will simply wish you the best and let you walk away.

I do wish you the best, but not in everything.

I hope you think about me from time to time, and maybe even miss me.

I hope that months from now you wake up in the night wondering what you’re missing, and wonder if it’s me.
